# I-Wanna-Reach-The-Unity

Fangame made in Unity Engine. This was a project for my Computer Science, but since it was never meant to be public I didn't ask for permission of other creators. You can give me shit for this, but I don't care since the is not promoted in any way üëè

The release version of 100% finished game - I Wanna Reach The Unity. Inspired by many other I Wanna Be The Guy fangames, this game is a medley of several other well-known titles, BUT it is made in Unity Engine, hence the name.
