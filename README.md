# I Wanna Reach The Unity ‚õé


*Disclaimer: This is a fangame made in Unity Engine as a final project for my Computer Science class. I didn't ask for permission from original creators since the game was never meant to be public. You can give me shit for this, but I don't care since the game is not promoted in any way üëè*

The release version of 100% finished game - I Wanna Reach The Unity. Inspired by many other I Wanna Be The Guy fangames, this game is a medley of several other well-known titles, BUT it is made in Unity Engine, hence the name.
